# senior-refactorings
This project contains some important content for an experimental hands-on refactoring using the senior projects

## Setting up the project

Install [nodeJs](http://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local machine if you don't already have it

**Install all the dependencies:**
```
npm install
```

## Getting started

**First of all run the tests:**
```
npm test
```

It's really important that you run the tests for every refactoring, see the TDD lifecycle below:

**Let's cut to the chase!**

Inside the src directory you'll find a bunch of files ending with a ".new" suffix. These files are there for you to refactor them! Keep in mind, just only one refactoring at time.
After your refactoring you can compare the new file to mine, get into the "final" folder and find out how I did refactor the files.
